# Coin Detection Problem

## Overview

This activity aims to detect and identify coins (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies) from an input image using template matching. The objective is to calculate the total amount of money represented by these coins.

## Requirements

- Python 
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- scikit-image
- matplotlib

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
  -opencv-python
  -numpy
  -matplotlib
  -scikit-image
4. Place your input image (`coins.png`) and template images (`Quarter.png`, `Dime.png`, `Nickel.png`, `Penny.png`) in the `images` folder.

## Assumptions

Assume that we are given an image containing more than one each of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies. Also, you are given template images of these coins in a standard 300x300 canvas.

## Outcome

Detect each coin and tell me the amount of money represented in the image.
